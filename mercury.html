            Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, <br />
            sits closest to the Sun but isn't <br />
            the hottestâ€”Venus holds that title due to its thick atmosphere.<br />
            Mercury, only a bit bigger than the Moon, is dotted with many impact craters.<br />
            Its rapid orbit around the Sun, taking just 88 Earth days, <br />
            is fittingly named after the quick-footed Roman god, Mercury.

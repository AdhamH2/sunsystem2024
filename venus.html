            Venus, the second planet from the Sun and sixth largest in our solar system,
            <br />
            holds the title of the hottest planet. Named after the goddess of love,
            <br />
            Venus is often dubbed Earth's twin due to its similar size and proximity.
            <br />
            However, despite its benign namesake,
            <br />
            Venus presents a hellish environment.
            <br />
            Its surface temperature can melt lead,
            <br />
            and its dense atmosphere reduces the
            <br />
            Sun to a mere blur of light from the surface.

          <p>
            Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun,
            <br />is the third largest in our solar system,
            <br /> measuring four times wider than Earth.
            <br />This planet is enveloped in a chilly and windy atmosphere
            <br />and features faint rings and over two dozen small moons.
            <br />Its distinct nearly 90-degree axial tilt causes it to rotate
            on its side,
            <br /> making it appear to spin horizontally. Uranus's blue-green
            hue is due to the presence of methane,
            <br /> which absorbs red light and reflects blue, giving the planet
            its striking color.
